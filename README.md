# angryshout
Ever wanted to vent your frustration with the world with fewer keystrokes? Now you can!

This is a simple npm package that converts a string to uppercase and adds '!?!?!' to the end of it for those moments when polite punctuation just won't cut it.

## Installation
```shell
npm install angryshout
```

## Usage
```javascript
const { angryshout } = require('angryshout');
```

## Example
```javascript
console.log(angryshout('in this economy'));
// Expected output: IN THIS ECONOMY!?!?!
```

## Is that it?
Yes, that's it.
